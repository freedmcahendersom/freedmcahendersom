The proposal provides one alternative in which lenders issuing conventional payday loans of up to $500 would be exempt from conducting the full-payment test. (See Table 1, Section 1.) To limit potential consumer harm associated with unaffordable loan payments, the draft rule specifies that if the borrower took a second loan within 30 days, it must be at least one-third smaller than the initial loan, and a third consecutive loan must be two-thirds smaller than the initial loan. For example, if the first loan is for $450, the second would be for no more than $300, and the third would be for no more than $150.
