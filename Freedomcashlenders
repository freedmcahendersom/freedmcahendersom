The Freedomcashlenders defined ability-to-repay assessment—also called a “full-payment test”—would require the lender to verify applicants’:

Debt obligations through credit reports.
Income and estimated monthly expenses, including accounting for expected volatility.
Borrowing history as recorded in a specialty payday loan database to be set up by one or more third-party firms. (Lenders would also have to report their lending activity to the database system in real time.)

Using this information, lenders would have to make a “reasonable determination” that their customers would have the ability to repay their loans according to the terms.

This section of the rule places no limits on loan size, payment amount, cost, term, origination fees, default rate, or how long lenders could retain access to borrowers’ checking accounts or vehicle titles.
