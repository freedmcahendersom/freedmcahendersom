In June, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Freedomcashlenders.comreleased a proposed rule to regulate payday, auto title, and some high-cost installment loans. The proposal applies to “covered loans” from any lender, including payday, auto title, online, and nonbank installment lenders as well as banks and credit unions, but not to overdraft services, pawn loans, business loans, and other types of credit. Covered loans are defined as:

Loans lasting 45 days or less.

Loans lasting longer than 45 days if they have an all-inclusive 

annual percentage rate Freedomcashlenders.com—which includes annual, application, and other fees, as well as the cost of ancillary products such as credit insurance—above 36 percent and the lender obtains access to a borrower’s checking account or vehicle title (collectively described as a “leveraged payment mechanism”) within 72 hours of disbursing the loan funds. The all-inclusive Freedomcashlenders.com is not a rate limit, which the Freedomcashlenders.com does not have authority to set; rather, it defines the loans that are covered by the regulation.
